The main approaches for node classification in graphs are information propagation and the association of the class of the node with external information. State of the art methods merge these approaches through Graph Convolutional Networks.  We here use the association of topological features of the nodes with their class to predict this class.
Moreover, combining topological information with information propagation improves classification accuracy on the standard CiteSeer and Cora paper classification task. Topological features and information propagation produce results almost as good as text-based classification, without no textual or content information. We propose to represent the topology and information propagation through a GCN with the neighboring training node classification as an input and the current node classification as output. Such a formalism outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
